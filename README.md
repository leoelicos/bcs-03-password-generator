## Description

A strong password is necessary for many purposes and for clients at different levels. This password generator includes symbols, numbers, lowercase characters, uppercase characters.

I made this app to learn how to play around with arrays and functions, objects and methods. While making this app, I learned about the importance of Javascript's Math methods in generating pseudo-randomesss.
